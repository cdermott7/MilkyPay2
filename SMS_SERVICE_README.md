## Implementation Details

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

1. **SMS Service**
   - Implemented Twilio integration for sending SMS messages
   - Created proper phone number validation and formatting
   - Generated claim links with configurable app URL
   - Added environment variable support for different environments

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/sms/claim-link` - Send claim link via SMS
   - `/api/sms/status-update` - Send transaction status updates
   - `/api/sms/verify-phone` - Verify and format phone numbers

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Added `APP_URL` configuration for proper claim link generation
   - Added Twilio credentials configuration
   - Implemented fallbacks for development environments

### Frontend (React)

1. **Router Implementation**
   - Added React Router for handling claim links
   - Implemented `/claim/:claimId` route for claim pages
   - Added a test page at `/test-sms` for testing SMS functionality

2. **SMS Service**
   - Connected frontend SMS service to backend API
   - Added client-side phone number validation
   - Implemented proper error handling and user feedback

3. **Claim Page Components**
   - Implemented `ClaimPage` component for claiming funds
   - Created a PIN entry interface with validation
   - Added success/error states with animations
   - Connected to wallet hooks for processing claims

4. **Test Utilities**
   - Added `TestSMSPage` component for testing SMS functionality
   - Created developer-friendly scripts for quick testing

## Environment Setup

The following environment variables are required:

```
# Twilio configuration for SMS
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+15551234567

# Application settings
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000 (development)
APP_URL=https://app.milkypay.io (production)
```

## Testing

1. Start the development servers:
   ```
   ./start-dev.sh
   ```

2. Navigate to the test page:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/test-sms
   ```

3. Enter a phone number and amount to test the SMS service

4. The SMS will be sent with a claim link like:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/claim/test-claim-1234567890
   ```

5. The receiver can click the link and enter the PIN to claim their funds

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Set the proper environment variables:
   - `APP_URL` should point to your production URL
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` should be set to production Twilio credentials

2. Test the SMS functionality in the production environment to ensure proper link generation and delivery

## Troubleshooting

- If SMS messages are not being sent, check Twilio credentials in the `.env` file
- If claim links are not working properly, ensure `APP_URL` is set correctly for your environment
- For development without Twilio, the service will log messages to the console instead of sending actual SMS
